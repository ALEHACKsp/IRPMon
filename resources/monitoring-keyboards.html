<h2>Monitoring Keyboards with IRPMon</h2>
<p>
Since keyboards (and mice) are with us for a very long time, one may expect that their drivers in Windows should be quite old-fashioned and will probably use IRPs as the main communication channel. Since IRPMon, as its name suggest, is capable of monitoring IRPs, we will use it to research details of the communication with keyboard devices.

<p>
As probably any other general-purpose operating system, WIndows support keyboard devices connected via different interface types, such as PS/2, USB or Bluetooth. Each of the interfaces is serviced by a different device driver: i802prt.sys (PS/2), kbdhid.sys (USB), *** (Bluetooth). To make things simpler for those wishing to control the keyboard devices, all these drivers export an unified interface that is then consumed and extended by the Keyboard Class Driver (kbdclass.ys). The task of the keyboard driver is to hide differences between different types of keyboard devices and expose the devices to the upper layers of the operating system.

<p>
Individual keyboard devices are represented by physical device objects (PDO) managed by drivers responsible for corresponding interfaces (USB, PS/2 etc.). The kbdclass driver attaches itself above the PDOs as an upper filter driver. Additional devices may be attached to the resulting device stacks if they are specified as lower or upper filters for the Keyboard device setup class (or use another method for monitoring the stack changes). Figure 1 shows keyboard device stacks present on my laptop with additional keyboard device connected via USB. i802prt.sys and kbdhid.sys act as function drivers.

At first, we will focus on how the operating system communicates with the Keyboard class driver, especially how keyboard events are retrieved. To achieve this, we instruct IRPMon to monitor both devices belonging to the driver. To do so, select the Action -> Select drivers / devices..., look up the keyboard devices and check items Hook (monitor the device/driver), IRP (monitor IRPs) and IRP completion (monitor IRP completions). The IRPMon driver starts monitoring after we press the OK button. To display logged requests, the Monitoring -> Capture events item needs to be checked.

Figure 2 shows IRPMon output for an event of pressing the A key on the PS/2 keyboard. IRPMon detected four events:
